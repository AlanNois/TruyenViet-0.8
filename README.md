# **Notice!**

## Important Notice: Extension Updates for [Nettruyen](https://www.nettruyenvv.com/) and [Nhattruyen](https://nhattruyenss.com/)

There is currently downtime on the main website for [Nettruyen](https://www.nettruyenvv.com/) and [Nhattruyen](https://nhattruyenss.com/). This situation may temporarily affect the functionality of the following extensions:

* **[Nettruyen]**
* **[Nhattruyen]**

**Here's what you need to know:**

* Once the website restoration is complete, both extensions will automatically update to the latest version. 
* If you'd like to receive updates before the website is restored, you have two options:

    1. **Wait for Automatic Update:** This is the simplest option. Once the website is back online, the extensions will automatically update with the latest features and bug fixes.
    2. **Manual Update (For Advanced Users):** 
        * You can clone the extension repository and modify the code to your liking based on the latest website changes (if applicable). 
        * After making your modifications, submit a pull request on Git to contribute your changes back to the main repository. 

**Please note:** Manually updating the extension requires familiarity with Git and coding. It's recommended for advanced users only.

**Stay Updated:**

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the temporary outage. We'll keep you updated on the website restoration progress.

**Questions?**

If you have any questions regarding extension updates or the manual update process, please feel free to open an issue in the [Issues](../../issues) section of the repository.

**Thank you for your patience and understanding!**
