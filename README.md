**Important Notice: Extensions Update and CuuTruyen Development**

**Extensions Update:**

- The extensions for [Nettruyen](https://www.nettruyenvv.com/) and [Nhattruyen](https://nhattruyenss.com/) are no longer maintained due to the websites being offline. These extensions will not receive further updates.

- Fixed bug with image in some chapter of [TruyenQQ](https://truyenqqviet.com/) extension

**CuuTruyen Extension:**

While I have a potential solution to bypass the DRM protection for CuuTruyen, adapting it to work seamlessly with the PaperBack extension is currently beyond my capabilities. To achieve this, I would require assistance from developers familiar with the GitHub environment and coding.

**Call for Collaboration:**

If you're a coder interested in contributing to this project, here's how you can help:

1. **Project Discussion:** Open an issue on this repository to discuss potential approaches for developing the CuuTruyen extension.
2. **Code Contributions:** If you have the expertise and are willing to contribute code, feel free to fork the repository, make your modifications, and submit a pull request.

**Looking Forward:**

I'm committed to finding a solution for CuuTruyen, and I believe that collaboration with skilled developers can make it happen. Let's work together to enhance the user experience!

**Additional Notes:**

- You can remove the extensions since the extensions are no longer maintained.
- "I have dengue fever, which may cause some delays in updates. I apologize in advance for any inconvenience this might cause if the extension malfunctions during this time.

**Stay Updated:**

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the temporary outage. We'll keep you updated on the website restoration progress.

**Questions?**

If you have any questions regarding extension updates or the manual update process, please feel free to open an issue in the [Issues](../../issues) section of the repository.

**Thank you for your patience and understanding!**
